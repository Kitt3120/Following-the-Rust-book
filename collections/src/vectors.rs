/*
In Rust, the Vec<T> type is designed to store values of the same type in a contiguous block of memory.
This means that the actual values are stored next to each other in RAM, not just the pointers.
When you create a Vec<T>, it allocates a chunk of memory to hold a certain number of elements of type T.
As you add elements to the Vec, they are stored in this allocated memory, one after the other.
If the Vec needs to grow beyond its current capacity, it will allocate a new, larger chunk of memory and copy the existing elements into the new memory block.
This process ensures that the elements are stored in a contiguous sequence in memory.

    The code might look like it should work: why should a reference to the first element care about changes at the end of the vector?
    This error is due to the way vectors work: because vectors put the values next to each other in memory, adding a new element onto the end of the vector
    might require allocating new memory and copying the old elements to the new space,
    if there isnâ€™t enough room to put all the elements next to each other where the vector is currently stored.
    In that case, the reference to the first element would be pointing to deallocated memory.
    The borrowing rules prevent programs from ending up in that situation.
