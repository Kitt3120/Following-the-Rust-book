/*
    Rust has a concept called associated types which are similar to generics, but are used in a different way.
    Associated types are used in traits to define placeholder types that will be used later in the trait.
    While it seems exactly like generics at first,
    the difference is that when using generics, we must annotate the types in each implementation.
    With associated types, we donâ€™t need to annotate types in each implementation.
